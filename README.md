agile-ecommerce-monitoring-suite

Project Description:

This project is a full-stack, integrated monitoring suite for e-commerce platforms, combining data from user experience (UX), backend system logs, and customer support tickets to provide comprehensive insights into system performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

⸻

Objectives:
	•	Analyze front office data such as user clicks, abandoned carts, and page load times to understand customer engagement and friction points.
	•	Monitor backend system performance, including API errors, server response times, and service availability.
	•	Track support ticket volume, resolution times, and common issues to evaluate customer service effectiveness.
	•	Generate dashboards and automated reports (Power BI dashboards, PDF summaries) for stakeholders such as managers, UX teams, IT, and support staff.
	•	Provide actionable insights that help improve customer experience, optimize system reliability, and enhance support operations.

⸻

Data Sources:
	•	clickstream.csv: Simulated user click data on website elements.
	•	cart_abandonment.csv: Records of abandoned shopping carts.
	•	page_load_times.csv: Measurements of page loading durations.
	•	api_logs.csv: Backend API call logs with status codes and response times.
	•	support_tickets.csv: Customer support ticket data including submission and resolution timestamps.

⸻

Technologies:
	•	Python for data processing and analysis.
	•	Power BI Desktop for dashboard visualization.
	•	Report generation with Python libraries (optional).
	•	Version control with Git and GitHub for project management.
